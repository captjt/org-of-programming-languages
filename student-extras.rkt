#| 
; `struct` is like `define-struct` but allows inheritance:
; When using this, include args `#:transparent` and possibly `#:consructor-name make-...` ).
; WARNING: in student-level, (struct foo (...)) objects always print as `make-foo` even though
;    the actual constructor-name is just `foo`.


; Usage example:
(require "student-extras.rkt")

(struct soup (a b) #:transparent)
(define make-soup soup) ; We can bind the traditional name to the *actual* constructor.

(make-soup 2 3)

(struct hotsoup soup (c d e) #:transparent)  ; inherit `soup`s fields.
(hotsoup 2 3 4 5 6) ; N.B. this prints as `make-hotsoup`, in beginner-student.
